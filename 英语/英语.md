我**治疗**过很多**焦虑患者**

I’ve **deal with** lots of people who have **anxiety disorders**

我对于焦虑症患者

one thing about people who have anxiety disorders

非常能够**理解**他们

is they are **not mysterious** to me

我完全懂

it's **no problem** for me to understand

人们为什么会得焦虑症

why people have anxiety disorders

为什么会抑郁

Or why they're depressed

为什么会**滥用药物**

Or why they have **substance use** problems

我难以理解的一直是

the mystery to me is always why

人为什么没有同时出现上述所有问题

people don't have all of those things at once

因为 每个人都有理由焦虑

because everybody has a reason to be anxious

事实上 我们有**终极的**焦虑理由

in fact we have the **ultimate** reason to be anxious

因为我们明确知道 自己是脆弱的

because we know that we're vulnerable

且必有一死

and we know that we're going to die

**在这种情况下**，人们是如何做到不焦虑的

how you can not be anxious **under those circumstances**

还真是个大谜题

it is a great mystery it's a massive mystery

抑郁也是如此

the same thing applies with regards to depression

在一定程度上

then the same thing applies to some degree

**酗酒和药物滥用**问题也是如此

with regards to **drug and alcohol abuse**

正如我上周所说的

Like I said last week,

世间有太多理由让人们选择**借酒消愁**了

there's plenty of reasons to **drown your consciousness in alcohol**

真是这样的：

that's for sure

比如我们**之前提到的**焦虑和抑郁

we could refer to the **aforementioned** anxiety and depression **not least**

人们**倾向**服用的药物都是些

the sort of drugs that people **are prone to** take are

让人们在面对人生不幸时 能够**减轻**痛苦的化学物质

the chemicals that **take the affective edge off** the tragedy of life

说回恐惧

back to the issue of fear

亚伯拉罕是有**自我意识的**

Abraham is **self-conscious**

这是这句话的意思

that's what this **commentary** says

但关键是 尽管如此 他依然前行

but the thing is as he moves forward despite that

他有自我意识，清楚危险的存在

he's self-conscious and he knows the danger

尽管如此他依然前行

but he moves forward despite that

这就是你应该有的人生态度

that's actually the appropriate response in the face of

当你不再天真 并理解生活本质时

actual non-naive understanding of what constitutes life

如果你只是天真幼稚地向前走

if you're naive and you move forward

这不算什么，因为你啥都不懂

it's like well what the hell do you know

天真之人没有勇气可言

there's no courage in naivety

因为你既不知道路上会遇到什么**阻碍**

because you don't know what there is to **stop** you

也不知道会**遇上**什么危险

you don't know what dangers you might **apprehend**

但是，**认识**到自己的问题所在

but to **be aware of** what it is that your problem is

并保持存在式的警觉与自我意识

so to be alert existentially or to be fully self conscious

意味着 你完全清楚自己的**有限性**

means that you're perfectly aware of your **limitations**

也知道自己可能被伤害

and how you might be hurt

然后 你再作出决定

and then to make the decision to move forward

尽管如此 你也要向着**未知且陌生**的前方迈进

into **the unknown** and **in the land of the stranger** anyways

这是通往美好生活的钥匙之一

that's one of the secrets to a good life

我这么说无惧反驳

I can say that really without fear of contradiction

因为在这一点上 **临床文献**非常清楚

because the **clinic literature** on this is very clear

要治疗那些恐惧

what you do with people who are afraid 

在**一定程度上**抑郁 但**一定**焦虑着的患者

and **to some degree** depressed but **certainly** anxious

**首先**，你**细致**地**弄清楚**他们在焦虑什么

is you **lay out** what they're anxious about **first of all** in detail

你在恐惧什么，你害怕发生什么

what is it that you're afraid of, what might happen

然后 你把这些**分解**成若干个 **理论上 能够解决的**小问题

you **decompose it into** small problems **hypothetically** **manageable** problems

接着 你**让**患者主动去**面对**

then you **have**the person **expose themselves to**

他们所恐惧的事物

this thing that they re afraid of

这不会让他们少一些害怕

and what happens isn't that they get less afraid

临床文献**说明**的不是这个

that isn't what the clinical literature **indicates** exactly

**而是** 患者会变得更勇敢

what happens **instead** is they get braver

少一些害怕和多一些勇敢**不是一回事儿**

and that's not the same thing

如果你不那么害怕了

Because if you get less afraid

就好像是你发现 “原来这个世界并不如我以为的那么危险

it's like, well the world isn’t as dangerous as I thought it was

我之前真傻

silly me

如果你变得更加勇敢， 你的想法不会是这样

if you get braver, that's not what happens

你会想，这鬼世界还真是和我想的一样危险

what happens is, yeah the damn world's just as dangerous as | thought

甚至比我想的还要危险

or maybe it's even more dangerous than I thought

但我內心中有种东西

but it turns out that there's something in me

能够**自愿接受**这种挑战

that responds to **taking that on** as a **voluntary** challenge

并**由此 茁壮成长**

and **grows and thrives** **as a consequence**

这是**毫无疑问**的

there's no doubt about this

甚至**心理生理学**的**研究**都清楚地表明了这点

even the **psychophysiological** **findings** are quite clear

如果你在两组人身上**施加**一个**压力源**

if you **impose** a **stressor** on two groups of people

对于其中一组，压力源是强行**施加**的

and on one group the stressor is **imposed** involuntarily

另一组则自愿**接受**压力源 

and on the other group the stressor is **picked up** voluntarily

自愿接受压力源的人

the people who pick up the stressor voluntarily

会使用一套完全不同的心理生理系统去应对压力

use a whole different psychophysiological system to deal with it

他们使用的是**应对**和挑战系统

they use the system that's associated with **approach** and challenge

而不是**防御性攻击**和**逃跑**系统

and not the system that's associated with **defensive aggression** and **withdrawal**

并且，与挑战有关的心理生理系统

and the system that is associated with challenges

会让人有多的积极情绪

is much more associated with positive emotion

和更少的消极情绪

and much less associated with negative emotion

这对你自身也不那么**严苛**

it‘s also much less **hard** on you

因为那个防御姿态系统，即**被捕食者**系统

because the defensive **posturing** system, the **prey** animal system

这个系统一旦**开启**

when that thing **kicks in**

所有系统都随时待命

it's all systems are go for you

**油门**一脚踩到底

the **pedals** pushed down to the metal

**放开刹车**

and **the brakes are on**

你为了**准备好**迎接**当下**的**突发状况**

you’re using future resources that you could be storing for a future time

而用掉原本可以为了未来而储存的资源

**right now in the present** to **ready** yourself for **emergency**

受到命运**召唤**而

there's nothing simple or **trivial** at all about

直率地向着**未知**与**陌生 迈进**

the idea of **being called to** move forthrightly forward

绝不是一种天真或**琐碎**的想法

into **the strange and the unknown**

并且，这会带来真正的冒险

there's a real adventure that's associated with that

这激动人心

so that's an exciting thing

这也是人们喜欢旅行的原因之一

which is part of the reason why people travel

而且，当你发现自己是那种

also to see yourself as the sort of creature that

能够并愿意不断应对挑战的人

can do that and is willing to do that **on a habitual basis**

你的**自尊心**（我讨厌这个词）也会得到**滋养**

is also the right kind of **tonic** for your (I hate this word) **self-esteem**

自尊和**自我感觉良好** **没有任何关系**

because the self-esteem **has nothing to do with** **feeling good about yourself**

这我之前已经说过了

as I already mentioned

首先 你**没什么理由**

**there isn't necessary reason** why

**想当然**地对自己感觉良好

**a priori** you should just feel good about yourself

但如果你看到自己

but if you can **view** yourself

敢直率地**行事**

**acting in** a courageous and forthright **manner**

与世界狭路相逢

and encountering the world

努力改善自己的**命运**

and trying to improve your **lot**

以一种非天真的方式冒险

and taking risks in a non-naive way

那么 你就拥有了能在夜晚**慰藉**自己的东西

then you have something that you can **comfort** yourself with at night

当你怀疑自己徒然而不幸的人生

when you're wondering what **the whole damn point** is

有什么鬼**意义**的时候

of your futile and miserable life

你需要这个

and that's necessary

这是**常有的事**

because **it's often** **the case** that you wake up at 4 in the morning

当你在凌晨4点醒来

or at least sometimes the case that you wake up at 4 in the morning

当**生活不太顺遂**

when **things haven't been going that well**

你深深**怀疑** 自己徒然而不幸的人生到底有什么意义

**wonder** just what the hell the point is of your futile and miserable life

你需要一些真实的东西 才能与之**抗衡**

you have to have something real to **set against** that

仅仅文饰〞我是个**有用的**人”

it can't be just **rationalizations** about

是不够的

how you're a **valuable** person among others

尽管你确实有用

even though that's true

这是不够的

that's not good enough

你需要更现实的东西与之抗衡

you need something that's more realistic to set it against that

而在自己身上**观察**到的勇气绝对是你需要的东西之一

and **observing** courage in yourself is definitely one of the things

在你生活**不稳定的**时候

that can help you **sleep soundly** at night

它可以帮助你在夜晚**安然入眠**

when things are **destabilized** a little bit around you


# 20220904 如何克服社交恐惧
打个比方说你有**社交恐惧**

let's say you're **socially** **anxious** okay

所以当你社交焦虑的时候会发生什么

so what happens when you're socially anxious

你参加一个party，然后你的**心跳**开始**加速**

you go to a party your **heart's** **beating**

因为party是个怪兽

the party is a monster

因为它在**评判**你

because it’s **judging** you

它在评判你，它把你放在低等的地位上来审视你

and it's judging you, it's putting you low down the dominance hierarchy

一个负面的评价也是这样

because that's what a negative judgement js

这个**阻碍**了你在性上的成功

and that **interferes** **with** your sexual success

这表明你本身被**无情的审视评判**了

and that means that you're **being harshly evaluated** by nature itself right

所以当你进入一个社交场合的时候，你**面对**一个代表着混乱的巨龙

so you are **confronting** the dragon of chaos when you go into the social situation

所以你做了什么

and so what do you do

你变得**弯腰驼背**

you like this like you **hunched** **over**

这是**低等地位**的表现

and that's **low** **dominance**

这可不能帮你太多

it's like well that's not going to get you very far

但是这是一个合乎逻辑的反应，当你**面对**一个**暴君**的时候

you know but that's a logical thing to do **in the face of** a **tyrant**

表明自己不是威胁

so I'm no threat

因为你知道当你看见一个暴君的时候，你已经死了

you know you look at the king and you're dead

我不是威胁，我弯腰驼背

Im no threat, I'm hunched over

那么你的**内心**在想什么

and then whats happening **internally**

他们在怎么看我，他们在讨论我什么

how are people thinking about me what are people thinking about me

我是不是看起来很蠢

am I looking **stupid**

我是不是看起来很蠢，天啊，我好尴尬，我讨厌这里，天，我**流太多汗**了

am I looking **foolish** jeez I‘m awkward I hate being here man I'm **sweating too much**

这都内化了，全都是以自我为中心

it's all **internallized** right it's all **self-focused**

眼睛完全没有在工作

the eye isn't work

你应该告诉人们的是

what do you tell people

不要阻止你自己的想法，因为你做不到的

stop thinking about yourself because you can't

这就像不要想白色的大象

it's like don't think of a white elephant

你不能教导一个人去不要想一件事

you can't tell someone to stop thinking about something

因为他们就**陷入死循环**了

because they **get caught in the loop**

你要跟那些社交焦虑的人说的是，看着其他人

what you do with socially anxious people is you say look at other people

因为当你看着人们的时候，他们会告诉你他们在想什么

because if you look at them you can tell what they're thinking

除非你完全不能跟人社交

unless you're **terribly socialized**

有些人是这样的

and some people are

他们没办法参加一个party的原因是因为他们根本不知道怎么去介绍他们自己

so the reason they can't go to a party is because they don't even know how to introduce themselve

因为根本没人教他们**怎么去做**

like they're just no one ever taught them **how to** **behave**

所以他们会是个非常好的行为疗法的候选人

and so they're really good candidates for behavior therapy

因为你能够向他们**展示**那些跟社会接受性有关的步骤和过程

**waIk them through** the process of how you actually manifest the procedures that are associated with social acceptability

但是大多数的人是有一点社交能力的

but most people aren't like that they have the ability

如果他们非常的**内向**和**情绪不稳定**

so if they're really **introverted** in high in **neuroticism**

他们通常可以做到较好的**一对一**谈话

they can usually talk quite well to someone **one-on-one**

如果我看着你

well if I look at you

如果你要跟一群人讲话的话，还有一件事要记住

it's another thing to do if you're ever speaking a group of people

永远不要跟群体讲话

never speak to the group of people

因为那根本不存在

that doesn't exist

你跟**每个个体**讲话

you talk to **individuals**

他们会向你**反射**整个群体

and then they **reflect for** you the entire group

因为群体之间的个体都是**相关的**

because they're all **entrained**

如果你看着一个人

if you look at one person

他们会向你**传达**其他人的想法

they **broadcast** to you what everyone's thinking

而且你知道怎么跟一个人讲话

and you know how to talk to one person

这个简单

so it's easy

**只要**你做到专注于那个人而不是你自己

**so as soon as** you focus on the person not you

你把你的注意力放在了外部

you **post** your attention outward

用你的眼睛，使你的注意力推到了外界，而不是你自己

use your eye push your attention outward and you

开始尝试用眼睛看

start watching

那么接下来你的自动机制就会切换进来了

well then all your automatic mechanisms kick in

你就停止变得尴尬了

and you stop being awkward

因为如果我们在交流，然后我在看这

because if we're talking and I'm looking here

我可不知道你接下来要做什公

I don't know what you're going to do next

我将会把一段**间隔**放在我们中间

And I'm going to put **disjunctions** into the

就像我们谈话的**旋律**中间有一个糟糕的**音节**

like there like a bad **chord** in the **melody** of our conversation

原因还是我没有专心和注意

again the reason is I'm not paying attention

这也是为什么**金字塔**的顶端是一只眼睛

so that's why the eye is the thing at the top of the **pyramid**

这表达的意思是，能让你赢**一系列**的权威等级体系的是眼睛

its like the thing that enables you to win **the set of** all possible dominant hierarchy is the eye

要专注

pay attention

这是最**关键**的问题

that's the **critical** issue

这就是留心注意的**能力**

it's the **capacity** to pay attention

你**最需要注意的**

what do you **pay attention to most**

是那些你的**右脑**示意是**异常的**

what your **right hemisphere** signals is **anomalous**

它吸引着你的注意

it attracts your attention

就像在表达这里有什么地方不对

ike this isn't going quite right

然后你会想，我不要去看那

I'm not looking at that

这就是你应该要看要注意的

that's what you look at thats what you look at

你要注意那些**不对的地方**

what's **not** **going right**

因为那些可能是可怕的怪兽将会吃掉你

because that's, see that's the terrible monster that might eat you

但那些也同时是你学到所有信息的地方

but it's also the place you get all the information

这也是你为什么要跟你的敌人交流

so that's why it's useful to have discussions with your enemies

因为他们会告诉你一些你所不知道的事情

because they will tell you things you do not know

这是件多么好的事情

and that's such a great thing

因为如果你有不知道的事情的话

because if you don't know them

你是不是没有你想象的那么聪明

well you're not very smart are you

还有**在将来**你遇到情况的时候，你会需要知道那些事情

you know there **may be a time** when you go somewhere that's the thing you need to know

可能你的敌人会告诉你为什么是个大傻瓜

and maybe your enemny will tell you why you're such a fool

当然他也会告诉你**一堆**事情不是真的

you know and **a bunch of** other things that aren't true too

但是**只要**有一件事情是**准确**的

but **even** one thing that's **accurate**

那就像，嘿，谢谢

it's like yeah thanks very much man

或许我可以**纠正克服那件事**

maybe I'll **do some work on that**

这样的话我就不会带着那个毛病向前

and I won't have to carry that forward

这也是为什么最可怕的**捕食者**通常拥有着金子

so and thaf's part of the reason again why it's always the terrible **predator** that has the gold

这就像那些人一样，他们告诉你你最不想要听的话

it's like it's the person who delivers the message you do not want to hear

这是很艰难的

so it's rough it's rough

但是又有什么关系，人生本来就是艰难的

but it doesn't matter, life is rough

# 20220905
我以前会在生气的时候打我的**记忆枕头**发泄情绪

I used to hit my **memory** **foam** **pillow**

但后来，它把我的**招式**都记下来了

But it memorized all my **moves**

你可能**想知道**我为什么会**变成**这样

You're probably **wandering** how I **ended up** in this situation


## **Defying the urge to quit**

It's an **urge**, It's an urge to be told, every champion has felt it, every president has felt it, every king has felt it,every lion has felt it, every winner has felt it, every soldier has felt it, every victorious person has felt it, the urge to quit.

这是一种**冲动**，一种被告知的冲动。每一位冠军都感受到了，每一届总统都感受到了，每一任国王都感受到了，每一头狮子都感受到了，每位赢家都感受到了，每个战士都感受到了，每一位成功者都感受到了它的敦促，放弃的冲动！

Don't you **give up on** your dream.I don't care

if you don't have the money,you don't have

the**help**,and you don't have the family for

it,and you don't have the **background** for

你也许要付出时间，你也许要付出努力，你也许

很迟缓，你也许很**愚钝**，你也许**一无所有**，但是

不要言弃！永远不要！别放弃！！

see some people quit because things are out

of control. Nobody quits what you can

control. but the moment you **get in** something

where you don't get your Way or you get

**reprimanded** or you get corrected or you go

through this or you go to the better,you go to

the other or it's bad conditions or bad

circumstances then **the first the**

**emerge to a mind** says is this is ridiculous I quit.

看到一些人放弃，因为事情已经失控了。没有人

制的，但当你陷入了事与愿近

到**谴责**，或者你得到纠正，或

或者你去的更好，你去另一

的条件或糟糕的情况，那么，**首先产生一个念头**

说“就是这太荒谬了，我放弃了”

Somebody in this room you've quit

so many

things that you've lost respect for yourself.you

saw the **glamour** you saw the healings be here

be here be here but let me show you what you

didn't see,I fought,I kept.

这个房间里的某个人，你已经放弃了很多事情，以

至于你失去了对自己的尊重，你看到了**魅力**，你看
